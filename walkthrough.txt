This is a simple walkthrough for the game.

I didn't implement any kind of consecutive events, but it would be fairly simple to add a prerequisite to the Item and check whether it's fulfilled in the use_item method.

To win, you need to get your awakeness and body temperature to at least 100 %. With this implementation, the only way to win is if you end up with 101 % of each.

Please don't type in anything except numbers as the option selection isn't validated.

How to win:
0) Have Wine installed and/or run the game with "path/to/game force"
1) You start out in the bedroom. Put the clothes on.
2) Go to the bathroom.
3) Take the Aspirin.
4) Take a shower.
5) Move to the living room.
6) Move to the kitchen.
7) Drink the coffee.
8) Go back to the living room.
9) Go outside.

Yay.
